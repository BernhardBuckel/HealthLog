# Searching your record

The command palette finds pages and settings, and it searches what you have
recorded.

## Opening it

Press **⌘K** on a Mac or **Ctrl K** elsewhere, or tap the magnifier at the
top right, and start typing.

## What it finds

Below the pages and settings, a section **In your records** lists the
entries that match what you typed:

- visits (procedures included)
- conditions
- documents, by title, file name and the text read from them
- vaccinations
- lab results
- medications
- symptoms
- workouts
- notes on mood entries, readings and illness days

Each hit opens where the entry lives: a visit on the check-ups page, a lab
result on its analyte, a note on a mood entry or a reading on its day, a note
on an illness day in its illness.

## How matching works

Case and accents do not matter, so "schulter", "Schulter" and "Schülter"
find the same entries. Umlauts can be typed as `ae`, `oe` and `ue` (and `ß`
as `ss`), which helps on a keyboard without them.

## Very large records

The search reads each kind of entry newest first and stops after a fixed
number of entries and a short time limit, so it stays quick on a record that
holds years of data. When it stopped before reaching the oldest entries, the
list says so. A more specific search term usually finds an older entry.

## Shared records

When someone has shared their whole record with you, the search works inside
that record too. An account shared with you section by section cannot be
searched: the search lays every section side by side, which a partial share
does not open.

## Privacy

What you type is sent to your instance in the body of the request, not in the
address, so it does not end up in a reverse proxy's access log or in the
browser history. The server does not log the search text either, only its
length and how many hits it found.

/**
 * Structural guard: every model call runs under the record owner's
 * response-timeout setting.
 *
 * The setting (Settings → AI → response timeout) used to be threaded by hand,
 * and only the briefing, the status notes and the Coach did it. Document
 * reads, document extraction, lab OCR and lab staging called the provider
 * without a `timeoutMs`, so each client fell back to its own 60 s literal and a
 * slow self-hosted model was cut off however high the setting stood.
 *
 * The setting is now bound to the provider instance by the resolver that hands
 * it out, and each client reads its ceiling through `callTimeoutMs`. A call
 * site therefore cannot forget it; what can still go wrong is structural, and
 * each way is pinned here:
 *
 *   1. a wire client reads `params.timeoutMs` (or a literal) itself instead of
 *      `callTimeoutMs(params, this.responseTimeoutSeconds)`;
 *   2. an exported resolver in `provider.ts` returns a provider it did not bind;
 *   3. a client is constructed outside `provider.ts`, where no resolver binds
 *      it (the offline evaluation harness is the one named exception);
 *   4. a surface opts out with `timeoutPolicy: "surface-ceiling"` without
 *      being named below with its reason.
 *
 * Its limit: it reads source text. A provider object built by hand in
 * production code that dials the network itself would slip all four matchers,
 * and so would a client class imported under an alias.
 * `response-timeout-binding.test.ts` and `provider-response-timeout.test.ts`
 * are what prove the behaviour end to end.
 *
 * Mutation check: put `params.timeoutMs ?? 60_000` back into any client, drop
 * `bindResponseTimeout` from `resolveProviderChain`, construct a
 * `LocalOpenAICompatibleClient` in a route, or add
 * `timeoutPolicy: "surface-ceiling"` to the document summary: each one goes
 * red here.

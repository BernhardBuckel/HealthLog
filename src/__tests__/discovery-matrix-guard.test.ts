/**
 * Structural guards on the correlation-discovery matrix.
 *
 * The matrix is a channel SET, and a channel set copied into four files is a
 * channel set that will differ in three of them. It did: the route and the
 * per-metric card folded in the environmental-exposure and custom-metric
 * families, the Coach `get_correlations` tool folded in neither, and the
 * period narrative folded in neither of those plus neither of the
 * compliance / symptom pair. Nobody wrote anything wrong — a family was added
 * where it was needed and the other call sites were not on anyone's screen.
 * `src/lib/insights/discovery-matrix.ts` removes the copies; these guards are
 * what stop a fifth one appearing.
 *
 * ## What each guard rests on
 *
 * T1 freezes who may FETCH a channel. A new surface that wants a matrix has to
 * either call the assembler or import a fetcher, and the second is the one this
 * catches.
 *
 * T2 freezes who may CONSTRUCT a channel — the `role: "behaviour" | "outcome"`
 * literal that makes a `NamedSeries`. A hand-rolled channel that never touches
 * `correlation-channel-series.ts` would slip T1 and lands here.
 *
 * T3 freezes who may SCAN. This is the weakest of the three and the most
 * likely to read as the strong one, so: passing T3 proves only that the list of
 * files calling `discoverCorrelations` has not changed silently. It says
 * nothing about what series those files pass. T1 and T2 are what make the
 * series the same series.
 *
 * ## What they cannot do
 *
 * They are tripwires, not proofs. A reviewer who waves through an addition to
 * an allowlist defeats all three. They match import statements and source
 * text, so a fetcher reached through a re-export, a dynamic `import()`, or a
 * channel built by a helper that takes `role` as a parameter would pass
 * unseen. And they cannot tell a deliberate divergence from an accidental one:
 * `assembleDiscoveryMatrix`'s options are where a real difference gets
 * declared, and only a reader can judge whether the reason written there is
 * a reason.
 *
 * Every match set below asserts a non-zero count. A matcher that has silently
 * stopped matching agrees with any allowlist, and that failure mode is exactly
 * how `bearer-scope-enforcement-guard` stayed green over a file it never saw.

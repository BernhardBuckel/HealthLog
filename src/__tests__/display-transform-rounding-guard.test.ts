/**
 * Guard for the converted-value precision class (issue #627, second half).
 *
 * Every entry in the display-transform registry declares the `decimals` its
 * unit is read at. Before v1.32.39 that number was carried all the way to the
 * render layer and read by exactly one screen out of all the ones that show a
 * converted value, so everywhere else the raw product of a kilogram and
 * 2.20462262185 reached the surface unrounded. The fix moved the rounding into
 * the conversion helpers, which means a surface gets a correctly-scaled number
 * whether or not it remembers to ask.
 *
 * This file guards the two ways that could be undone:
 *
 *   1. A PROPERTY over the whole registry — every branch, swept over a spread
 *      of raw values, must come out already at its declared grain, and a
 *      non-rescaling branch must come out byte-identical. A property test is
 *      the honest shape here: the thing being guaranteed is arithmetic, and a
 *      structural sweep for "did the surface remember to round" is exactly the
 *      per-call-site discipline this change exists to abolish.
 *   2. A STRUCTURAL freeze on the two ways to get an unrounded converted value
 *      anyway — importing the documented escape hatch, or hand-rolling
 *      `value * transform.factor + transform.offset` at a call site. Both sets
 *      are pinned to a named allowlist, so a new converted-value surface
 *      cannot quietly join them.

/**
 * Structural guard on the recent-proof gate.
 *
 * Exporting the whole record, making a clinician share link, minting a token,
 * and the admin backup, restore, wipe and reset actions ask for a fresh proof,
 * not only a live session (`requireRecentProof` / `assertRecentCookieProof` in
 * `src/lib/api-handler.ts`). This file pins which routes those are, so a route
 * cannot drop the gate, and a new one cannot quietly join the list of routes
 * whose Bearer arm still takes the token alone.
 *
 * Matching is on the IMPORT and then on calls of the local name, the way
 * `step-up-elevation-guard.test.ts` does it, so an aliased import is followed.
 * Every sweep asserts it matched something: a matcher that finds nothing agrees
 * with every list.

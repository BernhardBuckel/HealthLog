/**
 * v1.40 — GET /api/ai-runs/{id}: where one background document AI run stands.
 *
 * A plain read of a row the caller created: the run id came back in the 202
 * of the route that queued it, and the row is scoped to the caller here, so
 * another account's run (or one that never existed, or one an hour past its
 * end) is the same 404. No AI gate: serving the answer to a read the person
 * already asked for calls no model, and every capability question was asked
 * when the run was queued and again in the worker before anything left.
 *
 * `result` is the body the synchronous route answers with (by `kind`), and
 * `error` carries the code and status it would have answered with, so a
 * client handles both paths through one table.

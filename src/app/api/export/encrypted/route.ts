/**
 * POST /api/export/encrypted
 *
 * v1.23 — passphrase-encrypted variant of the full-backup export. Returns the
 * same payload as `GET /api/export/full-backup` (see that route's doc comment
 * for which domains restore recreates vs. export-only), sealed into an
 * `HLX1` archive (Argon2id-derived key + AES-256-GCM) under a passphrase the
 * caller supplies in the request body. The binary archive is returned as
 * `application/octet-stream`.
 *
 * SECURITY:
 *  - Fresh proof: `requireRecentProof`, the gate every whole-record export
 *    shares. A second factor within five minutes on an account that has one;
 *    otherwise a recent sign-in or a password re-proof.
 *  - The passphrase NEVER hits a log or wide-event: it is read off the parsed
 *    body, passed straight into the KDF, and never `annotate()`d. The egress
 *    redaction denylist already scrubs `/passphrase/i` (key-name) and the
 *    `passphrase=` query-string form as defence in depth.
 *  - There is NO server-side recovery — the passphrase is not stored. A
 *    forgotten passphrase means the archive is unrecoverable; the UI says so.
 *
 * Auth: cookie session with a recent proof; Bearer on the token alone for an
 * account without a second factor, with a second-factor `X-Step-Up`
 * elevation for one with.
 * Rate-limit: shared `export:<userId>` bucket (10/h) — same bucket as the
 * plaintext export so the encrypted variant cannot be used to bypass the cap.
 * Audit: `user.export.encrypted` with the row counts (never the passphrase).

/**
 * v1.18.9 / v1.18.10 — POST /api/labs/ocr/extract
 *
 * Read-only (NOT idempotent) extraction of a paper lab report into STRUCTURED
 * proposed rows for the mandatory human-review screen. Nothing is written to
 * the person's record here; the raw upload is never logged.
 *
 * v1.40 — the read runs in the background worker. This route answers every
 * refusal it can answer quickly (capability, provider, rate bucket, budget, a
 * malformed or oversized upload, an unknown file type), seals the upload or
 * the text into a `DocumentAiRun` (AES-256-GCM, dropped the moment the run
 * finishes, the row deleted an hour later) and answers 202 with the run id.
 * `GET /api/ai-runs/{id}` serves the proposed rows. Only the web client calls
 * this route, so there is no synchronous form to keep.
 *
 * Two modes, dispatched on the request content-type:
 *
 *   - VISION (multipart/form-data): a photo / PDF is uploaded and run through
 *     the user's vision-capable provider. The image transits server memory
 *     ephemerally.
 *   - TEXT (application/json, v1.18.10): the browser OCR's the image
 *     (tesseract.js) and POSTs only the extracted TEXT here. Any configured
 *     provider can structure it — no vision required — so a text-only provider
 *     (ChatGPT-OAuth/Codex, a text-only model) reaches the SAME review/commit
 *     flow. The raw image never reaches the server. Gated by the opt-in
 *     `labsLocalOcrEnabled` preference.
 *
 * Guards mirror the Coach's discipline in both modes:
 *   requireAuth → requireAiCapability("labsOcr") → resolve provider and
 *   re-check the capability for that pick (`requireLabsOcrProvider`: the
 *   operator's switch, the labs module, and a document consent receipt for a
 *   pick that leaves the machine) → rate-limit
 *   (`LABS_OCR_LIMIT_PER_HOUR`, default 6/h) → reserveBudget → queue the run.
 *   The worker resolves the provider again, re-checks the wire, runs the
 *   extraction and reconciles the budget (`src/lib/labs/ocr-run.ts`). A slot is
 *   charged early so a 429 stays cheap, and it is handed back when the scan
 *   fails before the provider is called.
 *
 * Extracted text is UNTRUSTED (prompt-injection): the server never acts on an
 * instruction inside the document — the human review step is the safety
 * boundary, and the commit route is the only write path.

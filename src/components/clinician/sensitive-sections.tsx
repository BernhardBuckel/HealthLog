/**
 * The `sensitive` group on the clinician view: family history, mood and the
 * menstrual cycle.
 *
 * These are the leaves the catalogue fences in the picker — no group checkbox,
 * never in the shipped template, so no single control can switch on more than
 * one of them at a time. That fence is about how they are CHOSEN. Once one is
 * on a link the owner chose it deliberately and named it, so it renders as an
 * ordinary card, exactly as the health-profile leaf beside it already does and
 * exactly as the PDF prints them. A second fence at render would read as the
 * page second-guessing a decision the person already made.
 *
 * The fourth leaf of the group, `ANAMNESIS`, lives in `./report-sections`
 * because it was the one that was already rendered.
 *
 * A pure server component: no client hooks, no session, no markdown — every
 * value renders as escaped React text.

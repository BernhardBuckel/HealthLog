/**
 * Where each dashboard strip tile leads.
 *
 * A tile shows one metric, and every metric with an Insights sub-page should
 * open it on click. The map is keyed by the tile-capable widget id and typed
 * against the sub-page slug union, so a destination that does not exist is a
 * compile error and a tile added to `TILE_CAPABLE_WIDGET_IDS` without a
 * decision here is one too. `null` means the tile deliberately leads nowhere;
 * the guard in `__tests__/tile-destinations.test.ts` demands a written reason
 * for every such entry and fails when a tile's metric has a sub-page the tile
 * does not open. It exists because the body fat tile was the one tile that
 * led nowhere, documented as having "no dedicated sub-page" while every
 * body-composition sibling had one.
 *
 * A link never points at a page the account cannot see: the destination
 * passes the same `insights-page:<slug>` surface gate the tab strip uses.

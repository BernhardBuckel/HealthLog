/**
 * The one scope picker. Both surfaces that choose what a report contains — the
 * export panel and the share-link create form — mount this exact component, so
 * two selection UIs cannot drift apart.
 *
 * Nothing is ever selected for the user. A picker with an empty selection
 * stays empty until someone ticks something, and the one shipped template is
 * reachable only through the button at the top that carries its name. One
 * click still gets a complete doctor's report, so nothing got slower — but the
 * click happened, and that is the whole difference between a chosen scope and
 * a scope somebody merely failed to untick.
 *
 * Twelve group rows plus a fenced tier below a separator. The fenced tier has
 * NO group checkbox: there is no control anywhere in this component that can
 * turn on more than one sensitive leaf at a time, and there is no select-all.
 * The fence uses no colour to mark itself — a separator, a heading, and
 * per-leaf controls. A red tint would be decoration; status colour is reserved
 * for meaning.
 *
 * The component is controlled: it owns no selection state, only which rows are
 * expanded and what each group looked like before it was switched off.
 *
 * `surface` is required because Settings → Gesundheitsakte mounts the picker
 * twice on one page. Every test id under the picker ends with it, so each mount
 * stays uniquely addressable no matter how many surfaces adopt the component.

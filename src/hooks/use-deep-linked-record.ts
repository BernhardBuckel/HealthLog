/**
 * Open the record a link points at: `/vaccinations?dose=<id>`,
 * `/checkups?visit=<id>`.
 *
 * The link chips on a document name the record they point at, and a chip that
 * lands on a list with nothing selected leaves the person searching the list
 * for the one row they just tapped. Once the list has loaded, the row named by
 * `param` is scrolled into view and handed to `open` (the page's own edit
 * sheet, or nothing for a reader who may not edit). Each id is acted on once,
 * so closing the sheet does not reopen it on the next render.
 *
 * An id the list does not hold (deleted since, outside what this grant shows,
 * or older than the bounded list reads) is handed to `resolve` when the page
 * gives one, and the record it returns is opened; without `resolve`, or when
 * it finds nothing, the page simply renders as it would without the link.

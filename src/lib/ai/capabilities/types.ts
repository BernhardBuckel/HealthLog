/**
 * AI capabilities: the vocabulary.
 *
 * HealthLog works without AI. Every measurement, device record, computed score,
 * statistic and template sentence is served and accepted whatever the
 * assistant switches, the provider, the consent receipts or the Coach
 * preference say. What those layers decide is narrower: whether a model may be
 * called, and whether text a model wrote may be shown. That decision is made
 * once, on the server, per request and record, and it is published as one
 * object per capability below. Clients render from it and never recompute it.
 *
 * This file holds only the vocabulary and the frozen capability table. It has
 * no I/O and imports nothing that does, so every other part of the system —
 * the resolver, the loader, the route and job gates, the account payload, the
 * contract, the structural guards — can depend on it without pulling a
 * database client along.

/**
 * v1.35.0 — what decides the Health Score's composition, pinned.
 *
 * The module switches used to decide it alone, from a stack of ternaries
 * inside the reader that nothing could see and nothing tested. This file
 * is the regression test the capability audit found missing, written for
 * the NEW semantics: the stored recipe says what counts, the modules say
 * what there can be data for, and the score takes the intersection.
 *
 * Three promises live here.
 *
 * 1. **Nobody's number moves on upgrade.** Every module combination with
 *    a never-written recipe resolves to exactly the set the ternaries
 *    built. The old expression is reproduced verbatim below as
 *    `compositionBeforeTheSwap`, so this is a real before-and-after
 *    comparison rather than a restatement of the new code.
 *
 * 2. **A module that is off removes the pillar entirely.** Not a score,
 *    not a "waiting for data" line, no row at all. That line belongs to
 *    a pillar someone selected and could still record today; a module
 *    they switched off is not waiting for anything.
 *
 * 3. **One breadth rule, applied twice.** The settings write refuses a
 *    selection that cannot produce a score; the reader grades the set it
 *    resolved through the same rule. The block at the bottom drives the
 *    REAL reader and asserts the basis it published is
 *    `evaluateScoreBreadth`'s verdict on the reader's own resolved set,
 *    so a second copy of the rule that disagreed would show up here.
 *
 * The reader runs against a fake Prisma rather than hand-built pillar
 * inputs on purpose: the composition is assembled halfway down that
 * function, and a test that skips it would prove the wrong end.

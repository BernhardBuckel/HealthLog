/**
 * v1.38 — the rule that keeps invented targets dead.
 *
 * The Health Score once graded weight against `22 × height²`, widened by
 * 2 kg either side: a band nobody set, no surface named, and the only
 * thing producing that pillar's verdict. v1.34 removed it and the rebuild
 * that followed left a pillar set where every scored band cites somebody.
 * Nothing but review has been keeping it that way since, and review is
 * what let the original in.
 *
 * So the rule the pillar set already obeys is written down here:
 *
 *   A pillar is scored against a cited clinical threshold, population
 *   band or guideline band, and nothing else. A yardstick belonging to
 *   the person rides `personalReference` beside the scored band (blood
 *   pressure does this) or stays unscored context (the weight goal). No
 *   band is synthesised from a profile field the person did not set.
 *
 * Three arms, because one is not enough to catch the class:
 *
 *   T1 — every scored reference names a citation, in one of the three
 *        declared kinds, free of first-person-yardstick vocabulary.
 *   T2 — the falsifiable one. Sweep every pillar across a matrix of
 *        profiles (height, age) and the scored bands it emits must fall
 *        inside a small enumerated set of PUBLISHED bands declared below.
 *        An invented target is a continuous function of a profile field;
 *        a guideline band is a step function into a published table. No
 *        finite enumeration can hold the former, which is precisely what
 *        makes this arm able to fail.
 *   T3 — the tripwire. Profile fields may be read inside a pillar module
 *        only where this file says so and says why, and every documented
 *        use must still exist.
 *
 * The mutation proof lives in T4: the pre-v1.34 weight pillar, restored
 * as a fixture in today's shape, is run through all three arms and each
 * rejects it. A check that cannot fail is worse than none.
 *
 * What the guard cannot do: judge whether a citation is HONEST. "ESH
 * 2023" could be attached to a band the ESH never published and every arm
 * would pass. It pins the shape of the promise and the set of values, not
 * the scholarship — that stays a reviewer's job.

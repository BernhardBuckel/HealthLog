/**
 * Recompute the cached cycle forecast for one account from the persisted
 * rows, without a request.
 *
 * `CyclePrediction` is not a cache of a read — it is the index the
 * cycle-reminder cron scans to find who is due a period-soon or fertile-soon
 * push. Until v1.35.3 its only writer was `GET /api/cycle/calendar`, which
 * meant the reminders an account received depended on whether somebody had
 * opened the calendar recently, and the write itself was a discarded promise
 * inside a `try {} catch {}` that swallowed the failure. Both ends are fixed
 * here: the refresh runs on the schedule that consumes it, and a failed write
 * throws so the job reports it.
 *
 * The reads mirror the calendar route's default window so the forecast the
 * cron scans and the forecast the calendar renders come out of the same
 * inputs.

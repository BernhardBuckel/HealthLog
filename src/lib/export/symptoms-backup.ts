/**
 * Person-defined symptoms, with both backup ends in one file (v1.40).
 *
 * Same arrangement as `ecg-backup.ts` and `reminders-backup.ts`: a reader
 * asking "is this carried at both ends?" answers it here, and a reader who
 * greps only the restore route gets a false negative because the route
 * delegates.
 *
 * ## Events ride inside their definition
 *
 * An occurrence means nothing without the symptom it is an occurrence of, so
 * the file nests each definition's events under it, the way a medication's
 * side effects ride inside the medication. A nested create binds the child to
 * whatever id the parent row actually got, so there is no definition reference
 * to resolve and none that can dangle.
 *
 * ## Free text follows the note contract
 *
 * A disaster-recovery payload carries the label and note ciphertext verbatim
 * as base64 (the same instance's key reads it back unchanged). A portable
 * export decrypts both, because a portable file exists to be readable by the
 * person who owns it and to restore under another instance's key. A label this
 * instance cannot decrypt travels as the visible unreadable marker rather than
 * as nothing, the rule `records-backup.ts` states for notes: the definition is
 * still the person's, and an empty name would read as one they never gave.
 *
 * ## The one reference that needs care
 *
 * `episodeId` addresses an illness episode and is a real foreign key. A
 * portable export omits soft-deleted episodes, so an occurrence filed against
 * an episode the person has since deleted names a row the file does not carry.
 * The restore resolves the reference against the episodes it actually wrote
 * and NULLS a miss (reported as `symptomEpisodeReference`) rather than writing
 * it and rolling the whole restore back. The occurrence is the record; the
 * episode link is a cross-reference.

/**
 * Illness correlation + recovery-gap engine (v1.18.1, Workstream B / P3).
 *
 * Server-authoritative, reliability-first. Given ONE illness episode this
 * assembles three retrospective findings — never a prediction, never a
 * diagnosis — each gated by the shared coverage/confidence model so a thin
 * signal asserts NOTHING:
 *
 *   1. **Pre-onset anomaly scan** — the N days BEFORE onset, each tracked
 *      vital's deviation in robust SDs from the user's OWN baseline (median
 *      ± MAD, the same `computeVitalsBaseline` engine), the baseline computed
 *      from a window that ENDS before the pre-onset lookback so the episode's
 *      own physiology can never poison the baseline it is measured against.
 *      "How did it announce itself?"
 *   2. **Nadir / what-dropped** — across the episode's active span, the
 *      furthest each vital strayed from baseline (the nadir day + magnitude +
 *      direction). "What dropped."
 *   3. **Recovery-gap** — the intellectual core: physiological return-to-
 *      baseline (first day a previously-deviated vital re-enters its band and
 *      STAYS in for `RETURN_STABILITY_DAYS`) vs the felt-better marker
 *      (`resolvedAt`). The gap is `physiologicalReturn − feltBetter` in days:
 *      positive = the body lagged the feeling (you felt better before your
 *      numbers did), negative = numbers normalised first. CHRONIC_ONGOING is
 *      excluded (no recovered date).
 *
 * The directionality of "worse" is metric-specific (a HRV/recovery DROP and a
 * resting-HR/temperature RISE both mean "stressed"); `ADVERSE_DIRECTION`
 * pins it per metric. Red-flag patterns (a sustained large oxygen-saturation
 * drop, a sustained fever) ESCALATE to a "seek care" flag — never reassure.
 *
 * Pure given its inputs: the caller does the bounded reads (baseline series +
 * per-day vital means within the episode window) and passes them in, so the
 * whole engine is unit-testable against golden fixtures with no DB. The route
 * wires the reads; the parity test asserts the rollup-fed path and a raw-SQL
 * path agree.

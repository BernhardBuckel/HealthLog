/**
 * v1.25 — "what changed since your last panel" shaping.
 *
 * Groups the user's numeric lab results by panel DATE (the calendar day of
 * `takenAt`, UTC), finds the two most-recent dates, and for every analyte that
 * appears in BOTH the latest and the previous panel reports the signed delta,
 * the direction, and where the latest value sits against the reference window
 * in force for it — the range that reading's own report printed when it has
 * one, the catalog band otherwise, resolved through the shared
 * `resolveEffectiveReferenceRange`. Qualitative (valueText-only) results carry
 * no numeric value, so they are skipped — a delta is meaningless for them.
 *
 * Pure + Prisma-free so the present / absent states are unit-testable: it is
 * absent when there are fewer than two panel dates, no analyte is shared, or
 * the newest panel is older than `LAB_CHANGE_RECENCY_DAYS`. Neutral framing
 * only — a delta is not a diagnosis.

 * holds. Someone whose newest panel is years old was still being shown "what
 * changed since your last panel", which is not a stale piece of UI state — it
 * is a stale STATEMENT.
 *
 * A year, and not less, because routine panels are commonly drawn annually. A
 * shorter window would hide a comparison that is genuinely the newest thing
 * the person has for months of every year. Past a year the wording cannot be
 * defended at all, so the comparison stops being surfaced rather than being
 * re-worded into something nobody asked for.
 *
 * Expressed on the DATA, not per user: nothing to acknowledge, nothing to
 * persist, no housekeeping asked of anyone, and every client — web and iOS —
 * reads the same answer through the existing `present: false` contract.

// --- Tag × health-metric crosstab (v1.12.0) ------------------------------

/**
 * v1.12.0 — per-tag × health-metric crosstab.
 *
 * Daylio's "Activities & Mood" board answers "how does my mood differ on
 * days I tagged X?". This extends the same with-vs-without comparison to a
 * health METRIC: for each structured mood tag present on enough days, the
 * metric's mean on tag-present days vs tag-absent days, the delta, the
 * Welch two-sided p, and a confidence band — reusing the EXACT statistics
 * engine the F1 tag-influence board already runs (`welchTTest` +
 * `influenceConfidence` + the per-group day floors). FDR-corrected across
 * every tested (tag × metric) pair via the shared `benjaminiHochberg`
 * step-up so the surface stays honest as the matrix grows.
 *
 * Pairing modes:
 *  - "sameDay" — the metric on the SAME day the tag was logged. Used for
 *    activity (a workout/active tag × ACTIVE_ENERGY_BURNED) and sleep (a
 *    sleep tag × SLEEP_DURATION).
 *  - "nextDay" — the metric on the day AFTER the tag (D → D+1 lag join, the
 *    same lag the correlation-discovery engine uses). Used for an
 *    alcohol/food tag × the overnight-recovery channels — readiness
 *    (RECOVERY_SCORE), resting heart rate and heart-rate variability —
 *    where the plausible direction is "tonight's choice → tomorrow's
 *    recovery".
 *
 * Observational only — the UI renders the standing "association, not
 * cause" caption once. The metric value is shown in its display unit
 * (SLEEP_DURATION minutes → hours; energy kcal; recovery score 0..100).

/**
 * v1.14.0 — the flagship cross-domain insight: "on days you rated <factor>
 * low, your <vital> ran X below baseline".
 *
 * A RATED mood factor (work / sleep-quality / stress …) is a CONTINUOUS
 * per-day score, unlike the BINARY structured tags `computeTagMetricCrosstab`
 * handles. To reuse the EXACT same Welch + FDR engine, this thresholds the
 * factor's daily mean into a binary membership — a day is "low" when its
 * factor mean sits BELOW the factor's own median over the window, "high" at
 * or above. The median split is robust + self-calibrating (always two
 * non-empty groups when the factor has spread), and invents no fixed cutoff.
 *
 * `inverse` is applied at the SERIES boundary (the factor's per-day mean is
 * flipped to `(scaleMin + scaleMax) - raw` for an inverse factor like
 * stress), so the median split — and therefore the "low day" label — always
 * means "a worse day for this factor", honestly, without per-call casing.
 *
 * Same honesty discipline as the tag crosstab: both sides need
 * `CROSSTAB_MIN_PRESENT_DAYS` / `CROSSTAB_MIN_ABSENT_DAYS` paired metric
 * days, the family is BH-FDR corrected as one (across every factor × metric
 * × direction pair), survivors clear p < 0.05 AND q ≤ `CROSSTAB_FDR_Q`, and
 * the surface is capped + ranked. Observational only — the card renders the
 * standing "association, not cause" caption.

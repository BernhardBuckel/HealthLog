/**
 * Output-language contract for the PERIOD NARRATIVE surface.
 *
 * The bug this pins: the read route narrowed every non-English locale to `de`,
 * so a French, Spanish, Italian or Polish reader received a German
 * retrospective composed from the German instruction body. The fix keeps the
 * two reviewed bodies (de, en) and lets the other four ride the English body
 * with their language named and their OWN reply-language directive appended.
 *
 * Three things are asserted here, in ascending strength:
 *  1. the four locales name their language and carry the verbatim directive
 *     from the translator-facing `safety-contracts.<locale>.yaml`;
 *  2. no non-German prompt contains a German-body sentinel — the "nothing
 *     silently falls back to German" assertion this whole change exists for;
 *  3. the German and English prompts are byte-identical to their pre-change
 *     form, modulo the prompt-version string, pinned by content hash.

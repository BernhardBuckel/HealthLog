/**
 * v1.11.0 — period-narrative CONTEXT assembler (Pillar 1, no LLM).
 *
 * `buildPeriodNarrativeContext(userId, { period, now })` assembles the
 * structured, compact, provenance-carrying data a LATER wave (B-W3) narrates.
 * This wave produces NO prose and makes NO LLM call: it is a pure assembly
 * over the rollup tier + derived layer + the existing FDR-controlled
 * correlation engine. Every beat in the context is `label + number + source`
 * so the generator can ground each sentence in a citation, and so the surface
 * can render provenance chips.
 *
 * The honesty contract carries through verbatim from the layers it reuses:
 *  - **Drivers** are ONLY the BH-FDR-surviving pairs from `discoverCorrelations`
 *    (`benjaminiHochberg` already enforces descriptive-never-causal); each
 *    keeps its conservative `interpretation` string unchanged. The channels
 *    scanned come from the one shared assembler in
 *    `src/lib/insights/discovery-matrix.ts`, so this surface sees the same
 *    families the correlations page and the Coach do. It differs in exactly
 *    one declared way — it admits the user's RATED mood factors as
 *    `FACTOR:<key>` channels, which the three persisting surfaces do not; the
 *    reason is written at the `includeMoodFactors` option.
 *
 *    It also silently lacked, until the assembler landed, the
 *    medication-compliance, symptom-severity, environmental-exposure and
 *    custom-metric families, which had arrived at the route and never
 *    here. Nothing explained that; the comment that appeared to was the
 *    same sentence a sibling file carried while doing the opposite.
 *  - **Band transitions** are a personal-baseline (median ± k·MAD, Hampel/Leys)
 *    comparison of the current period against the band established over the
 *    PRIOR period — never an invented threshold.
 *  - **Coincident flags** carry the same `COINCIDENT_FIRE_THRESHOLD` / direction
 *    framing the live flag uses.
 *
 * Data-availability gate: the assembler returns an `insufficient`-style shape
 * (`{ status: "insufficient", reason, coverage }`) when the period has too
 * little history to narrate — never a fabricated story. The floor mirrors the
 * derived layer: ≥ 2 metrics each with ≥ `MIN_COVERED_DAYS_PER_METRIC` covered
 * days in the current period.
 *
 * Split into a PURE core (`assemblePeriodNarrativeContext`, fully unit-testable
 * over injected series, no DB) and a thin DB wrapper that fetches + day-keys +
 * delegates. The core is the one place the descriptive-only invariants live.

/**
 * v1.10.0 — computed scores (WX-E). The Strain score ENGINE + persistence.
 *
 * A daily cardio-load proxy (0–100, higher = more training strain) built
 * from the per-workout heart-rate series (`WorkoutSamples`, WX-D) plus
 * active-energy burned (`ACTIVE_ENERGY_BURNED`).
 *
 * CARDIO-LOAD MODEL — Banister's TRIMP (Training Impulse).
 * For each workout's HR series we compute the gender-weighted exponential
 * TRIMP:
 *
 *     TRIMP = Σ (Δt_min · HRr · 0.64 · e^(1.92 · HRr))     (men)
 *     TRIMP = Σ (Δt_min · HRr · 0.86 · e^(1.67 · HRr))     (women)
 *
 *   where HRr = (HR − HRrest) / (HRmax − HRrest) is the fractional
 *   heart-rate reserve per sample, Δt_min the minutes that sample
 *   represents, HRmax the age-predicted maximum (Tanaka 2001:
 *   208 − 0.7·age), and HRrest the user's resting heart rate.
 *
 * Standard: Banister EW, "Modeling Elite Athletic Performance" (1991);
 * the gender-weighted exponential form is from Morton, Fitz-Clarke &
 * Banister 1990, J. Appl. Physiol. 69(3):1171–1177. Tanaka HRmax:
 * Tanaka, Monahan & Seals 2001, J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 37(1):153–156.
 *
 * The per-workout TRIMP values are summed across the scored day to a
 * day-total TRIMP, then mapped to the 0–100 scale by a saturating curve.
 *
 * v1.10.3 — PERSONAL-RELATIVE ANCHOR. The 0–100 map is anchored to the
 * USER'S OWN recent training-day load, not a fixed population reference: the
 * reference that maps to score ≈ 63 is the EWMA-smoothed 75th percentile of
 * the user's own training-day (TRIMP > 0) day-total TRIMP over a 42-day
 * chronic window (the acute-vs-chronic framing Garmin Training Load uses,
 * the personal-zone idea WHOOP uses). This makes the score meaningful for a
 * deconditioned or chronic-condition user, who would otherwise be pinned near
 * 0 against the population anchor regardless of how hard *they* worked. Below
 * a 7-training-day cold-start floor the engine falls back to the fixed
 * population anchor (`STRAIN_TRIMP_REFERENCE` ≈ a hard hour), recorded as
 * `anchor: "population"`. The anchor is derived from the TRIMP INPUT, never
 * from the 0–100 OUTPUT, so there is no circular feedback.
 *
 * Days with NO usable HR series but WITH active energy fall back to an
 * active-energy-only proxy so a "logged but no series" workout still
 * registers some strain (clearly the weaker signal, and with no personal
 * intensity distribution it stays on the population anchor — the provenance
 * records which path + which anchor produced the score).
 *
 * Honest confidence: the score is only stored when the day carried at least
 * one workout HR series with usable samples OR a non-trivial active-energy
 * total AND the user profile yields an HRmax (needs age) + a resting HR.
 * Below that the engine returns `insufficient` and NO row is written.
 *
 * Row shape (identical posture to the Recovery + Stress scores):
 *   - `type   = STRAIN_SCORE`
 *   - `source = COMPUTED`
 *   - `unit   = "score"`
 *   - `value  = 0..100`
 *   - `externalId = strain:YYYY-MM-DD`
 *
 * The score is descriptive — a daily training-load proxy, NOT a clinical
 * assessment. In the doctor PDF it is segregated into a clearly-labelled,
 * disclaimed Wellness-summary section, kept out of the clinical-vitals body.
 * Server-only — runs from the nightly pg-boss job in
 * `src/lib/jobs/strain-score.ts`.

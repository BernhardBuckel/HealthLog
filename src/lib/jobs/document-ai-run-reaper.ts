/**
 * Five-minute reaper for background document AI runs (v1.40).
 *
 * A run carries its next deadline in `expiresAt`, and this pass acts on it:
 * a run no worker picked up within fifteen minutes fails as
 * `aiRuns.workerUnavailable` (its reservation handed back), a run past the
 * time its model calls were allowed fails as `aiRuns.timedOut`, and a run
 * that finished an hour ago is deleted with its sealed result. Every step is
 * a conditional write on the state it leaves, so a tick that overlaps a
 * worker, or a second tick, changes nothing twice. The next tick is the retry.

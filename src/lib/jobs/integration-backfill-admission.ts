/**
 * The admission job's expiry: sixteen hours, so a legitimately long import

 *
 * Without it every admission job took pg-boss's default of fifteen minutes.
 * A full-history import of a per-minute heart-rate stream is thousands of
 * pages (a page is 1 000 readings, about seventeen hours of a watch's
 * history, so five years is some 2 600 pages), and at a few seconds a page on
 * a slow link that is hours. Past the expiry pg-boss fails the job and retries
 * it while the handler keeps running (`integration-backfill-lock.ts`), and the
 * import that could not finish in fifteen minutes started over beside itself.
 *
 * The runs that honour the job's budget (`jobBudget`, three quarters of this)
 * stop on their own at twelve hours, which is still some 8 000 pages at five
 * seconds each, and are retried or re-offered at the next boot. The expiry is
 * also what ends a run that hangs: the lane is freed for the next import, and
 * the import lock keeps a retry from starting beside the stuck run. pg-boss
 * refuses an expiry of 24 hours or more.

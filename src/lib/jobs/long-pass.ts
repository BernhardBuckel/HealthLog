/**
 * The binding for a queue whose job can outlast pg-boss's default expiry.
 *
 * Three things together make a long job safe, and `queue-runtime.ts` names
 * every queue that needs them:
 *
 *   1. An explicit `expireInSeconds` on every send and schedule, so pg-boss
 *      does not declare the job dead at fifteen minutes while it is working.
 *   2. A time budget (`jobBudget` / `jobDeadline` in `job-budget.ts`) the
 *      handler checks between units of work, so the pass stops on its own
 *      before that expiry and the next run picks up what is left.
 *   3. A lock the running handler holds (`withJobLock`), so the retry pg-boss
 *      starts once the expiry has passed does nothing beside a run that is
 *      still going. Queue policies cannot do this: they constrain job rows,
 *      and an expired job's row is no longer active.
 *
 * `lockedPass` is the third. It wraps a handler so each job runs under the
 * lock `<queue>:<identity>`, where the identity is what two runs must not
 * share: the account for a per-user job, a constant for a pass over everyone.
 * A delivery that finds the lock held reports `already_running` and succeeds,
 * because the run that holds it is doing the work.

/**
 * Retention and maintenance cleanups: rate-limit rows, idempotency keys, audit logs, OAuth states (Withings / WHOOP), mood-reminder events, push attempts, and measurement tombstones.
 *
 * Extracted from reminder-worker.ts, which owns the queue names, cron
 * schedules, and the queue bindings.
 *
 * Every pass in here used to catch its own failure, write a warning nobody
 * reads, and return — so a retention purge that had not run for weeks was
 * indistinguishable from one with nothing to delete. They now return
 * `jobFailed`, which fails the pg-boss job and puts the queue on the operator's
 * failing-jobs surface.
 *
 * That change has a price, and the registrars pay it: these are bulk DELETEs
 * over a retention horizon, and their failure mode is deterministic. A
 * statement that timed out against a large trailing edge times out again
 * immediately. Under pg-boss's default policy (retryLimit 2, no delay, no
 * backoff) each converted queue would run the same doomed statement three
 * times in a row every night. So every cron-driven cleanup registered from
 * this module is scheduled with `retryLimit: 0`: the failure is recorded once
 * and the next night's tick is the retry, which is the right backoff for
 * retention work that has a whole day of slack.

/**
 * Daily prune for the bounded notification-delivery ledger.

 * Every sender (APNS, WEB_PUSH, TELEGRAM, NTFY) writes one
 * fire-and-forget row to `push_attempts` per dispatch. The admin
 * diagnostic endpoint only ever reads the trailing 20 rows per user,
 * so anything older than the 90-day retention window is dead weight
 * inflating the table and the `(user_id, created_at DESC)` index. Record-only
 * notification events are claims rather than delivery diagnostics, but after
 * the same horizon their dedup windows have elapsed and they have no reader —
 * with one carve-out: state-scoped admin-config-notice anchors
 * (`CONFIG_NOTICE_EVENT_TYPE`) hold for as long as the configuration state
 * they describe and are released explicitly on state exit, so the horizon
 * delete must not touch them or the once-per-state notice re-fires every
 * 90 days.
 *
 * The DELETE is unbounded by user. The event and attempt ledgers carry direct
 * `created_at` indexes, and final egress claims carry `authorized_at`, so each
 * trailing-edge scan is bounded by the size of the live working set. On a
 * one-million-row table with the documented retention
 * window, the daily prune touches ~11k rows (1M / 90d × 1d) and

/**
 * Daily retention for `workout_insight_generation_claims`.
 *
 * The claim row is the ledger behind the per-workout insight daily cap, and it
 * outlives its workout on purpose: deleting a workout nulls the claim's
 * `workout_id` instead of removing the row, so the delete cannot free the
 * day's slot. The cap only ever reads today's rows, so anything older than the
 * retention window is dead weight and is dropped here.
 *
 * Keyed on `updated_at`, which moves on every claim, reclaim, provider
 * invocation and completion. A row written within the window is kept whatever
 * its `local_date` says, so no row that the cap can still read is ever
 * deleted.

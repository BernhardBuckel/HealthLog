/**
 * Spelling-level comparison of lab units.
 *
 * A reading may only be stored under a marker whose unit it actually is in, so
 * the write paths compare the unit a reading arrives with against the unit the
 * marker is tracked in. This module answers one narrow question: are these two
 * strings the same unit written two ways?
 *
 * It resolves spelling, never magnitude. Two spellings are treated as equal
 * only where no reading of either could mean a different quantity:
 *
 *   - whitespace around the slash (`mg / dL`),
 *   - the micro prefix (`µg/L`, `μg/L` with the Greek mu, `ug/L`, `mcg/L`),
 *   - the case of the litre in the denominator (`mmol/l`, `mg/dl`, `mg/DL`),
 *   - a unit printed entirely in capitals (`MG/DL`, `MMOL/L`), but only for the
 *     short list of units where capitals cannot denote another real unit.
 *
 * Case is otherwise significant, on purpose. `mIU/L` and `MIU/L` differ by a
 * factor of a billion (a lone capital M is mega, a lowercase m is milli), and
 * `g/L` (grams) is not `G/L` (the 10^9/L of a blood count). A unit this module
 * does not recognise is compared exactly, so an unfamiliar spelling surfaces as
 * a mismatch rather than being guessed at.
 *
 * Pure and dependency-free.

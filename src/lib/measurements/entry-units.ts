/**
 * Where the entry form asks for one unit and the column stores another.
 *
 * This is not the metric/imperial display transform in `display-transform.ts`:
 * that one follows a preference and is the identity for anyone on metric. This
 * one holds regardless of preference, because the storage unit was chosen for
 * the sync sources rather than for the person typing.
 *
 * Sleep is the case. `SLEEP_DURATION` is stored in minutes — every provider
 * delivers minutes, and a per-stage segment is only a few of them — while a
 * person logging a night by hand thinks in hours and the field says so. The
 * form sent the typed number straight through, so a night entered as 7.5 was
 * stored as seven and a half MINUTES and read back on the list as eight
 * minutes of sleep. Nothing rejected it: seven and a half minutes is inside
 * the column's plausibility band, because a single sleep STAGE really can be
 * that short.
 *
 * The storage unit stays minutes. The conversion belongs at the entry
 * boundary, in one place, so a second surface that starts taking sleep by hand
 * has one answer to reach for rather than its own.
 *
 * Only the direction that exists is here. An inverse and a "does this type
 * convert" predicate shipped alongside it at first, written for an editing
 * surface that does not exist and has no ticket; they were nothing but two
 * more things to keep true. The git history holds them if that surface ever
 * arrives.

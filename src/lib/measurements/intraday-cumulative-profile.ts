/**
 * v1.34.0 — the intraday shape of a cumulative day, kept before the fold
 * destroys it.
 *
 * A cumulative metric has no meaningful "latest reading": four thousand steps
 * is a good day at 09:00 and a poor one at 22:00, and `signals-of-day` excludes
 * steps for exactly that reason. The only honest comparison is against the same
 * person's own typical total AT THE SAME LOCAL HOUR — and that needs an hourly
 * substrate, which did not exist. `drainPerSampleCumulative` collapses the
 * per-sample Apple Health rows into one daily total after the 36-hour grace
 * window and hard-deletes the originals in the same transaction; Fitbit,
 * Withings and Polar write daily totals directly and never had an intraday
 * stream at all.
 *
 * This module owns that substrate, in three parts:
 *
 *   1. `foldHourlyCumulative` — the PURE fold. Per-sample rows for one local
 *      day become 24 running totals, element `h` carrying everything
 *      accumulated through the END of local hour `h`. No IO, so the drain and
 *      the live read share one definition of what a day's shape is.
 *   2. `mergeIntradayCumulativeProfile` — the write the drain calls INSIDE its
 *      own transaction, immediately before the delete. Keyed on
 *      `(userId, type, dateKey)` and additive, so a day drained twice keeps
 *      both halves.
 *   3. `readCumulativeDayProfiles` — the trailing-window read the same-time
 *      baseline issues. Persisted rows for the drained days, a live fold for
 *      the days still inside the grace window (which have no row yet), so the
 *      current day is always available.
 *
 * The table is a SIDECAR. The canonical `stats:<HKType>:<day>` measurement
 * stays the reading of record; nothing here is a measurement, and no read path
 * takes a value off this table that the measurement rows do not already carry.

 * caller may hand over a padded window without corrupting the day.
 *
 * DST costs nothing here. A fall-back day's repeated local hour folds into its
 * one slot, and a spring-forward day's skipped hour simply repeats its
 * predecessor's running total. Every stored day therefore has exactly 24 slots
 * and is index-comparable with every other, which is the only property the
 * same-hour comparison actually needs.
 *
 * Returns `null` when the day carried no usable per-sample row — an honest
 * absence, never a zero-filled profile. A day with genuinely zero steps that
 * WAS sampled comes back as a real profile of zeros; a day nobody measured
 * comes back as nothing, and the two must not be confused.

/**
 * Add one fold onto the stored profile for its day, inside the caller's

 *
 * The drain calls this immediately before deleting the rows the fold came
 * from, so the shape is committed by the same commit that destroys its source
 * — there is no window in which the samples are gone and the shape was never
 * written.
 *
 * The merge is ADDITIVE, and it has to be. The drain deletes what it folds, so
 * it only ever hands over rows nobody folded before: a day drained at the grace
 * cutoff and then drained again a week later after a late watch sync would lose
 * its first eleven hours under last-write-wins. Element-wise addition of two
 * running totals is exactly the running total of the union, because a cumulative
 * sum is linear — so the merged curve is the same one a single fold over all the
 * rows would have produced.
 *
 * The caller must serialise its own reads and writes for the day; the cumulative
 * drain does, under the per-bucket advisory lock it already takes. And the
 * caller must pass only rows still LIVE at merge time: a re-run or the
 * serialised loser of two overlapping ticks sees none, folds nothing, and never
 * reaches here.
 *
 * A stored profile cut on a different timezone is replaced rather than added
 * to. After a move the old curve's hours mean something else, and summing the
 * two would produce a shape that describes no day that ever happened.

/**
 * The rows a metric series reads, restricted to the source the user's priority
 * ladder picks for each day.
 *
 * The rollup tier and sleep already resolve every (type, day) to the
 * ladder-winning source before they aggregate. The dense and raw reads of
 * `/api/measurements/series` filtered on user and type only, so with a second
 * provider a day's value blended the two and the configured ladder had no
 * effect on those charts. This is the one place that applies the same rule to
 * them, through the same SQL helper the other live readers use.
 *
 * Only a type that HAS a ladder is collapsed (`RANKED_TYPES`). For a type
 * without one (glucose, body water, bone mass) the helper would break the tie
 * by source name, which silently hides one of two real sources, so those keep
 * every source exactly as before.
 *
 * Returns a FROM-clause subquery aliased `m`; the user id is bound as `$1`.

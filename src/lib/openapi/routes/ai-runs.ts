/**
 * OpenAPI route table for background document AI runs (`/api/ai-runs/*`).
 * The request header and the 202 the queuing routes share live in
 * `./ai-run-accepted.ts`, so this module can read the result schemas of the
 * routes it serves without an import cycle.
 *
 * Part of the OpenAPI route table; aggregated in `./index.ts`.
 *
 * iOS coordination (v1.40): `POST /api/documents/inbound/{id}/index`,
 * `…/summary`, `…/suggest` and `…/extract` keep their 200 bodies when the
 * request carries no `Prefer` header. A client that sends
 * `Prefer: respond-async` gets 202 with a run id and polls the run here; the
 * result is the body the route would have answered with, except for extract,
 * whose run carries `DocumentExtractRunResult`.
 * `POST /api/labs/ocr/extract` (web only) always answers 202.

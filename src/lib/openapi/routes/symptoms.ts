/**
 * OpenAPI route table for person-defined symptoms (`/api/symptoms`, v1.40).
 *
 * Part of the OpenAPI route table; aggregated in `./index.ts`. Request bodies
 * and queries reuse the runtime Zod schemas from `@/lib/symptoms/shared` so the
 * wire contract stays single-source; response shapes mirror the DTOs the
 * routes serialise (decrypted label and note, the 30-day summary).
 *
 * Every route rides the illness module: an account that turned it off (or an
 * operator-disabled instance) answers 403 `illness.disabled` even to a valid
 * Bearer token.

/**
 * v1.17.0 (F4) — Polar AccessLink sync.
 *
 * Pulls Nightly Recharge (→ RECOVERY_SCORE / ANS_CHARGE / HRV / RHR /
 * respiratory rate), sleep (per-stage durations on a reconstructed END-instant
 * timeline + sleep score), daily activity (steps + active energy + distance),
 * Training Load Pro (→ CARDIO_LOAD), and SpO2 (→ OXYGEN_SATURATION) for one
 * connected user, mapping each into `Measurement` rows tagged `source = POLAR`.
 *
 * Token model: Polar tokens do not expire and have no refresh path, so there is
 * no `getValidToken` refresh dance (the WHOOP shape). A revoked grant surfaces
 * as a 401 → `reauth_required` on the shared integration ledger (`polar` key),
 * exactly like Nightscout's token-rejected path.
 *
 * Isolation: the five vitals collections are settled independently
 * (`Promise.allSettled`), so a single dead collection — e.g. a 403 on SpO2 or
 * cardio-load on an account without the sensor or the higher tier — imports the
 * healthy four and records ONE partial failure rather than blanking every
 * collection. Mirrors Oura's shipped per-collection isolation, minus the
 * token-refresh leg Polar structurally lacks (a 401 is just a per-collection
 * failure the classifier maps to `reauth_required`).
 *
 * Window contract: every hourly tick re-reads the full server-fixed window for
 * each collection — 28 days for recharge / sleep / activity / cardio-load /
 * SpO2 (there is no narrower request and no pagination on any of them). A
 * late-synced device, a re-scored night, or a HealthLog outage shorter than the
 * window all self-heal on the next tick with no cursor or watermark. History
 * older than the window is an upstream cap, not a HealthLog gap. See the
 * client's per-fetcher docstrings for the verified per-endpoint windows.
 *
 * Idempotency: each row's `externalId` is `<date>:<fieldTag>`. The shared
 * reconciler protects both external and natural identity. Polar re-scores a
 * night for a short window after the fact, so an exact re-post overwrites in
 * place (WHOOP-style re-score), not first-write-wins.
 *
 * The measurement-write tail (per-row upsert → rollup fold → status-insight
 * invalidate) mirrors the shared WHOOP / Nightscout sync tail; it is NOT a new
 * write path.

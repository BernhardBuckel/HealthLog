 *
 * Folding. A field and a query are compared after the body-sites service's
 * folding (`normalizeSearchText`: Unicode compatibility form, marks stripped,
 * lower case, whitespace collapsed) plus the German spellings a keyboard
 * without umlauts produces: "ß" reads as "ss", and "ae", "oe", "ue" read as
 * "a", "o", "u". Both sides fold the same way, so "Schulter" finds
 * "schulter", "Hüfte" finds "huefte" and "Fuß" finds "fuss".
 *
 * Ranking. Every query word scores the best field it hits (a title, label,
 * site, reason or practitioner counts more than a kind word or a side, which
 * counts more than a note or an indexed-text hit). Results order by how many
 * query words they matched, then by score, then by a fixed kind order, then
 * newest first, then by id: the same query over the same record always
 * returns the same list, which is what the MCP offset cursor relies on.

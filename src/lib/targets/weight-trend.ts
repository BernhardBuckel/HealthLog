/**
 * Which way a weight change counts as progress, judged against the person's
 * own stored target rather than against gravity.
 *
 * The trend arrow, the 7-day delta and the comparison caption on the weight
 * tile used to be hard-wired `up-bad`: a falling number read green whatever
 * the person was aiming for. Someone below their target who was gaining, which
 * is exactly what they set out to do, saw every step coloured as a setback.
 *
 * The rule here is the whole answer, with no setting of its own:
 *
 *   - below the target band  → gaining is progress   (`up-good`)
 *   - above the target band  → losing is progress    (`up-bad`)
 *   - inside the target band → holding steady is     (`hold`)
 *   - no stored target       → the historical reading (`up-bad`)
 *
 * The target is the one the person entered on `/targets`, stored as
 * `User.thresholdsJson.WEIGHT` and narrowed by `resolveWeightTargetOverride`.
 * The height-derived WHO band is deliberately NOT a target here: nobody chose
 * it, and a band nobody chose is not a statement about which way they want to
 * move.
 *
 * Resolved on the server and published on the dashboard snapshot
 * (`tiles.weightTrend`) so the web tile and the native client colour the same
 * reading the same way. The web page's snapshot-disabled fallback calls this
 * same function; nothing else re-derives it.
 *
 * Pure and client-safe: no DB read, no clock.
